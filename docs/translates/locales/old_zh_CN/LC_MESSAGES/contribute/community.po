"before it gets merged. A committer who has the expertise of the "
"corresponding area would moderate the pull request and the merge the code "

"reviewers who are familiar with the area of the code. We encourage "
"contributors to request code reviews themselves and help review each other's"

"high-quality code review itself costs as much as the actual code "

"代码审查是确保代码质量的关键方法之一。高质量的代码审查可以防止长期的技术债务，对项目的成功至关重要。在合并请求之前，需要对其进行审查。具有相应领域专业知识的提交者将在合并请求准备就绪时审核请求合并和合并的代码。相应的提交者可以请求多个熟悉代码领域的审查者。我们鼓励贡献者自己请求代码评审，并互相帮助评审彼此的代码——请记住，每个人都自愿为社区贡献自己的时间，高质量的代码评审的成本与实际的代码贡献一样高，如果您帮了别人同样的忙，您的代码可以很快得到审查。"
