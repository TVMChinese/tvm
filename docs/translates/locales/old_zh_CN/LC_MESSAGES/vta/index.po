"The Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA) is an open, generic, and customizable"
" deep learning accelerator with a complete TVM-based compiler stack. We "
"designed VTA to expose the most salient and common characteristics of "
"mainstream deep learning accelerators. Together TVM and VTA form an end-to-"
"end hardware-software deep learning system stack that includes hardware "
"design, drivers, a JIT runtime, and an optimizing compiler stack based on "
"TVM."
