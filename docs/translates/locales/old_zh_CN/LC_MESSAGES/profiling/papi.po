"The Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) is a library that "
"provides performance counters on a variety of platforms. Performance "
"counters provide accurate low-level information about processors behavior "
"during a given execution run. This information can contain simple metrics "
"like total cycle count, cache misses, and instructions executed as well as "
"more high level information like total FLOPS and warp occupancy. PAPI makes "
"these metrics available while profiling."
