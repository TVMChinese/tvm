"microTVM is the effort to allow TVM to build and execute models on bare-"
"metal microcontrollers. microTVM aims to be compatible with a wide "
"variety of SoCs and runtime environments (i.e. bare metal, RTOS, etc). "
"However, some stable software environment is needed to allow developers "
"to share and reproduce bugs and results. The microTVM Reference Virtual "
"Machines are intended to provide that environment."
