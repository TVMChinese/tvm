"Checkout to :ref:`install TVM from source <install-from-source>`. Installing"
" from source gives you the maximum flexibility to configure the build "
"effectively from the official source releases. If you are interested in "
"deploying to mobile or embedded devices, you do not need to install the "
"entire TVM stack on your device. Instead, you only need the runtime and can "
"install using the :ref:`deployment and integration guide <deploy-and-"
"integration>`."

" TVM 堆栈。相反，您只需要安装运行时（runtime）部分，并使用 :ref:`部署和集成指南<deploy-and-"
