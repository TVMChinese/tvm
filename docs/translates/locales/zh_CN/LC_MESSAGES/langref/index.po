"Relay is a functional, differentiable programming language designed to be an"
" expressive intermediate representation for machine learning systems. Relay "
"supports algebraic data types, closures, control flow, and recursion, "
"allowing it to directly represent more complex models than computation "
"graph-based IRs can. Relay also includes a form of dependent typing using "
"*type relations* in order to handle shape analysis for operators with "
"complex requirements on argument shapes."
